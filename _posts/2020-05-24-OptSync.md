[Synchronous consensus protocols](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-11-11-authenticated-synchronous-bft/) tolerating Byzantine failures 
depend on the maximum network delay $\Delta$ for their safety and progress. The delay, $\Delta$ is usually much larger than actual network delay
$\delta$ since $\Delta$ is a pessimistic value. While synchronous protocols tolerating more than one-third will have executions with at least a $\Delta$ latency, recent synchronous protocols such as [Sync HotStuff](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-11-12-Sync-HotStuff/) have been
trying to reduce the reliance on $\Delta$ as much as possible.

Can we commit faster than a $\Delta$ time for some executions? This was a question introduced in [Thunderella](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-78375-8_1). They described the notion of 
*optimistic responsiveness* that allows synchronous protocols to commit in $O(\delta)$ time when certain optimistic conditions
are met. In their protocol, the optimistic conditions require an honest leader and $>3n/4$ honest replicas. They introduce a 
"slow-path--fast-path" paradigm with two distinct commit paths: (i) an optimistic fast commit path with a commit latency of $O(\delta)$,
and (ii) a slow synchronous commit path with a commit latency of $O(\Delta)$. The protocol makes an explicit switch between the two paths and replicas must explicitly know which of the two commit paths they are in.

When optimistic conditions are met, the replicas make an explicit switch to 
the fast path and switch back to the slow path through an intermediate transition phase when no progress is seen in the fast path. However, unfortunately, there is no easy way to determine if the optimistic conditions are met. If the replicas cautiously move to the fast path, they will have missed opportunities for committing early for some transactions. Otherwise, it may be the case that optimistic conditions did not hold requiring us to switch back to the slow path through the transition phase. A slow slow-path and a slow transition phase only worsens the problem. Can we do better? 

Can we always obtain optimal latency independent of the conditions?
 
We answer this question in our recent work on the [optimality of optimistc responsiveness](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/458.pdf). To answer this question, we first explain what optimality means for the latency of an optimistically responsive synchronous protocol, and then provide protocols with such an optimal latency.

**Lower bound**

Informally, our lower bound result says the following: 
There does not exist a Byzantine Broadcast protocol that can tolerate *$f \geq n/3$* faults and when all messages between
 non-faulty parties arrive instantaneously, achieves the following simultaneously under an honest designated sender:  
(i) (optimistic commit) a commit latency of $O(\delta)$ in the presence of $\max(1, n − 2f)$ faults,  
(ii) (synchronous commit) a commit latency of < $2\Delta − O(\delta)$ in the presence of f faults.

Any optimistically responsive synchronous protocol must have two commit rules, one when optimistic condition holds and the other one is used otherwise. Informally, the lower bound says that the sum of latencies of these two commit rules should be at least $2\Delta$. This bound on latency holds when the following conditions are met:
- The total number of faults tolerated $f \geq n/3$: otherwise, we can always commit responsively by using a partially synchronous protocol.
- The designated sender is honest: otherwise, a Byzantine sender may not send a value and no replica will be able to commit optimistically.
- The optimistic commit rule tolerates at least one fault: if this condition does not hold, we show an upper bound that circumvents this lower bound.
- All messages between non-faulty parties arrive instantaneously: this condition attempts to provide the best possible network conditions to a protocol. Hence, if a protocol does not have a good latency when this condition holds, it is unlikely that the protocol will do better when the communication is not instantaneous.


To address these concerns, we present an *optimistically responsive* protocols whose fast path and slow paths are active
simultaneously and requires no explicit switch. Replicas commit responsively when optimistic conditions are met 
and commit synchronously otherwise. Our protocols are optimal in terms of commit latency in both the paths. We justify optimality of
*optimistic responsiveness* with following lower bound:

**Theorem 1**
There does not exist a Byzantine Broadcast protocol that can tolerate *f > n/3* faults and when all messages between
 non-faulty parties arrive instantaneously, achieves the following simultaneously under an honest designated sender:  
(i) (optimistic commit) a commit latency of $O(\delta)$ in the presence of $max(1, n − 2f)$ faults,  
(ii) (synchronous commit) a commit latency of < $2\Delta − O(\delta)$ in the presence of f faults.

The lower bound says that if a Byzantine Broadcast protocol tolerating *f > n/3* corruption has an optimistic (fast) 
commit with latency $O(\delta)$ while still being able to tolerate $max(1, n − 2 f )$ faults, then the synchronous (slow)
 commit should have a latency $\ge 2\Delta − O(\delta)$ when tolerating f faults.

Next, we show an *optimistically responsive* protocol with a matching upper bound.

## OptSync: Optimal Optimistic Responsiveness with $2\Delta$ synchronous latency
OptSync commits responsively with a commit latency of $O(\delta)$ when the leader and $>3n/4$ replicas are honest and commit synchronously with a latency of $2\Delta$.
OptSync works in [steady-state-and-view-change](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-10-15-consensus-for-state-machine-replication/) paradigm with a single leader until an equivocation or no progress is detected.
A view-change protocol is executed to elect a new leader and ensure safety when the current leader fails to make progress.
We present core consensus protocol of OptSync in the steady-state.

1. **Propose.** The leader proposes a command *cmd*.  
2. **Vote.** On receiving the first valid proposal from the leader, a replica broadcasts a *vote* for *cmd* and forwards the leader proposal to all other replicas.  
3. **Commit.**  
  (i) **Responsive Commit.** If a replica receives $\lfloor 3n/4 \rfloor + 1$ *votes* for *cmd* and no equivocating proposals, commit *cmd* immediately. Notify commit to all replicas.    
  (ii) **Synchronous Commit.** If a replica does not detect an equivocation within $2\Delta$ time after voting, commit *cmd*.  
 
A replica commits *responsively* when it receives a *responsive quorum* of votes, i.e., $\lfloor 3n/4 \rfloor + 1$ for *cmd* (*responsive certificate*) and has not detected any equivocation.
Similarly, a replica *r* synchronously commits *cmd* if it does not detect an equivocation within $2\Delta$ time after voting. In this case, replica *r* receives at least a *synchronous quorum* of $f+1$ votes for *cmd* (*synchronous certificate*).
We note that a *responsive quorum* for *cmd* and a *synchronous quorum* for *cmd'* does not necessarily intersect at an honest replica. However, if there exists a *responsive quorum* for *cmd*, *cmd'* cannot be synchronously committed. Below we explain why this is the case.

<p align="center">

</p>

Suppose an honest replica *r* commits *cmd* *responsively* at time *t*. This implies two things (i) no honest replica has voted for a conflicting command *cmd'* before time $t-\Delta$, and (ii) all honest replicas will hear a vote for *cmd* by time $t+\Delta$.
The earliest an honest replica *r'* could have voted for *cmd'* is at time $t'$ such that $t-\Delta \le t' \le t$. Since, replica $r'$ learns *cmd* by time $t+\Delta \le $t' + 2\Delta$, it would not commit *cmd'* synchronously. 
Additionally, since a responsive quorum requires $\lfloor 3n/4 \rfloor + 1$ votes, two responsive quorums intersect at least one honest replica. Thus, no conflicting command could get committed responsively.

The above explanation suffices to argue why two conflicting commands cannot be committed at same log position. Within a state machine replication (SMR) setting,
replicas keep voting and committing new commands by extending on previously proposed commands thus forming a linear chain of commands. As we just saw, there could exist a *responsive certificate* and a *synchronous certificate* for conflicting commands.
As a result, there could be conflicting chains extending from conflicting *responsive* and *synchronous* certificates. We resolve this conflict by proposing a novel chain ranking rule that ranks *responsive certificates* higher than *synchronous certificates*
We refer the readers to our [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/458.pdf) for more details on chain ranking and complete protocol specification.

**Remark** 
In the paper, we also present an *optimal optimistic responsive* protocol with only $\Delta$ synchronous latency. This protocol requires all $n$ replicas to be honest to commit responsively.
Both of the above protocols include a synchronous wait during view-change when the current leader is replaced by a new leader.
Our third protocol presents an optimistically responsive view-change protocol and allows replicas to transition to a higher view with a latency of $O(\delta)$ during optimistic conditions.

This protocol is a joint work with [Ittai](https://research.vmware.com/researchers/ittai-abraham) and [Ling](https://sites.google.com/view/renling). Read more about it [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/458.pdf).
